# CprE_488_Image_Processing_Pipeline

- This project converts a RAW image/ Bayer image obtained from an ON Semiconductor Image Sensor connected to the ZedBoard, reconstructs the image and converts it into the HDMI readable YCbCr format before displaying it on the LCD screen
- Part 3 produces testing images on the screen using TPG (Test Pattern Generator)
- Part 5 is software implementation. It has two parts:
  1. prototyping of the image processing in MATLAB
  2. similar implementation on ZedBoard of actual images from the camera.
- Part 7 is the hardware pipeline implementation. The image processing is done in the hardware.
